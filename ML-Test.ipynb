      "This odd and pretentious novel is based on the true case of an innocent man who falsely confessed to a series of homicides. The nation is on edge in the wake of a series of mysterious disappearances. The targets, all older, solitary sorts, vanish and their presumed abductor leaves nary a clue but for a marked playing card. Oda Sotatsu is a young man living a life both unfulfilling and uninteresting. That is until he meets a troublesome couple, the supposedly charismatic Sato Kakuzo and his girlfriend, the alluring,Jito Joo. Clearly disturbed, they play games and place wagers where the loser has to physically harm himself. They attach to Oda, inducing him into  a wager after plying him with alcohol. After losing the game, he signs a detailed confession admitting culpability in the disappearances. Joo delivers the confession to the police and Oda is soon arrested, imprisoned, abused, tried and convicted. He is subsequently sentenced to death by hanging and executed, remaining silent throughout the whole ordeal. Enter journalist Bell who is drawn to the mystery while still pondering the dissolution of his marriage. The book is largely a series of transcripts of the bewildered and dismayed family members, interrogations, newspaper coverage of the trial and finally with Joo and Kakuzo.This book felt half baked.  The transcript style of telling the story contributed to the unfinished feel. The story lacked suspense and mystery but it was far from a searing condemnation of the Japanese justice system. Obviously a confession is the gold standard in Japanese jurisprudence because there was really no evidence that a crime was committed, much less that Oda committed one. Oda's behavior and refusal to speak or defend himself was inexplicable, even if one factors in traditional concepts of honor. Joo and Kakuzo fail to trigger the fascination that classically destructive couples do. They are not Sid and Nancy, Bonnie and Clyde or even Romeo and Juliet. They are boring and shallow. The ending is a total disappointment making the sacrifice and I use the term loosely of Oda's life stupid and meaningless.This could have been an examination of false confessions or an indictment of the death penalty. It could have been a haunting character study that addressed  the relevance of honor in modern society. The spare writing contributed to a dream like atmosphere but muted even the horror of the gallows. Oda remained a cipher. Despite the cool cover, this book was no more than two hundred plus pages of self indulgence. Pass.\n"
